Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `k2hr3_osnl` for local development.

1. Fork the `k2hr3_osnl` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/k2hr3_osnl.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd k2hr3_osnl/
    $ pip3 install pipenv
    $ python3 -m pipenv install -dev --python /path/to/python3
    $ pipenv shell

4. Create a branch for local development::

    (k2hr3_osnl) $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, 
   mypy, pylint and the tests, including testing other Python versions
   with make lint test

   Make sure you are in virtual environment::

    (k2hr3_osnl) $ make lint test

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    (k2hr3_osnl) $ git add .
    (k2hr3_osnl) $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    (k2hr3_osnl) $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for supported Python versions. Check
   https://github.com/yahoojapan/k2hr3_osnl/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::


    $ make test

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then visit the release page at https://github.com/yahoojapan/k2hr3_osnl/releases 
and create a new release note.

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
