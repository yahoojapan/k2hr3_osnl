**k2hr3_osnl** is an OpenStack_ Notification Listener that listens to notifications from
OpenStack_ services. OpenStack_ services emit notifications to the message bus, which is provided 
by oslo.messaging_. oslo.messaging_ transports notification messages to a message broker server. 
The default broker server is RabbitMQ_. When **k2hr3_osnl** catches a notification message from RabbitMQ_, 
it sends the payload to the K2HR3_ that is a role-based ACL system that provides access control 
for OpenStack virtual machine instances. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the components.
